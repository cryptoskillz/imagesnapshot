snapshot

 ☐ redo snapshot it has a whole list of image and it calls the api one at a time as this will let us make the UI function better.

 Table join (branch v2 / v3)

 ☐ recode the table.js to be more elegant and handle joins better
 ☐ replace table.js with table-join.js once we are happy it works as excepted. 


misc

 ☐ change the project id and project data id to a guid to make it harder to guess results
 ☐ add an api call to tie it into the CI's and such
